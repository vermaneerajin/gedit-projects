Description: For this plugin a project is just a directory path. A list of last opened
        files is stored in the user config directory. In the project directory itself
        no data is stored or changed by the plugin. In the sidebar are two lists:
         * Open Projects: projects with at least one open file
         * All projects: project directories that are known to the plugin,
           projects that contain subprojects are shown in a tree structure
        In the context menu you can perform some actions, including:
         * Open Project: restore all recently opened files of a project
         * View Project Folder: the project folder is opened with the default program
         * Close Project: all project files are closed (the file list is preserved)
         * Add Folder, Remove Folder: specify which folders are known as a project
         * Find Subprojects: search within the project folder for nested projects
        After installing and activating the plugin, you can invoke the settings
        dialog. There you can set up a directory that can be scanned for projects.
        Project directories are recognized by specific file names within the
        directory like VCS folders or files for build systems.
